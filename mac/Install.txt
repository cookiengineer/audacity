* To install or reinstall Tenacity, drag the "Tenacity.app" icon in the
   DMG window to the /Applications folder icon on the right. Alternatively,
   drag the "Tenacity.app" icon to any other location of your choosing.

* Do not double-click the "Tenacity" icon in the DMG to launch Tenacity
   from there.

* If you still have an "Tenacity" installation folder for a version before
   2.1.3, you will see working duplicates of Tenacity's shipped Nyquist
   plug-ins in the Generate, Effect or Analyze Menu. You may also see
   non-working duplicates of other previously shipped plug-ins. To clean
   up the duplicates please see:
